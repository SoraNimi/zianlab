*     Attention
*        1)  HDIF depends on the real distance from poly
*            spacer to contact center.
*            The value listed here is SPICE TEG value.
*            You should change it according to your layout.
*        2)  Please entry AD/AS and PD/PS.If you do not
*            entry,you can not get correct results.
*        3)  Please use bu30n1.skw file
